## Supabase Integration
This application leverages Supabase for cloud-based PostgreSQL database and authentication. Supabase provides real-time data syncing and seamless authentication across devices.

## Supabase Setup
Create a Supabase account at https://supabase.io if you donâ€™t have one.
Create a new project and configure your database (PostgreSQL).
Obtain your API keys from the Supabase project dashboard.
Backend Integration with Supabase
To connect your Django backend to Supabase for real-time data management and authentication:

Install supabase-py (a Python client for Supabase):
```
pip install supabase
```
Configure Supabase connection in Django settings (add to settings.py):

# settings.py
```
SUPABASE_URL = "https://your-project.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_API_KEY = "your-api-key"
```
Use the Supabase client to interact with your database for storing expenses and user data. For example:

from supabase import create_client
```
url = settings.SUPABASE_URL
key = settings.SUPABASE_API_KEY
supabase = create_client(url, key)

def add_expense(expense_data):
    response = supabase.table("expenses").insert(expense_data).execute()
    return response
Supabase will handle authentication, data syncing, and real-time updates between your backend and frontend, ensuring that any changes made on one device (e.g., mobile) are instantly reflected across all devices (web, mobile).
```

### Key Updates:
- **Supabase Integration**: Added instructions for setting up Supabase for cloud-based database and real-time syncing.
- **Device Compatibility**: Mentioned that the app is fully responsive and compatible across web browsers, mobile devices, and tablets.
- **Connection Details**: Instructions for connecting the Django backend to Supabase using the `supabase-py` client.

This should now cover all essential information and make the project setup clear, along with the added advantage of Supabase's real-time database and cross-device functionality.
